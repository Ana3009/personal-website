                    The degree I am taking is called Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science with a Year in Industry BSc. 
                    There are 7 modules throughout the first year and for each of them I provided a short description and a suggestive image
                    below. You can find the official descriptions of the modules

                        <p> 
                           This module introduces basic Software Engineering concepts needed in order
                           to develop simple software systems that have basic functional requirements.
                           The main and most interesting part of this module is the team project in which
                           the students need to develop an app for a "client" who is an older student.
                           The programming language introduced in this module is Ruby.

                        <p> 
                            This course develops mathematical concepts and techniques which represent 
                            the foundations of computing and are very important for the future computing
                            courses. The propositional logic at the beginning can be rather confusing at
                            a first glance but it gets better once you get a grip on it.

                            This module introduces programming concepts through Java programming language,
                            as its name suggests. There are a lot of practical exercises in which selection,
                            repetition, object-oriented programming concepts are introduced in order to solve
                            problems. The emphasis is placed on writing a well-structured, efficient and readable
                            code.

                        <p> 
                            This module provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence by discussing key 
                            concepts, such as whether a computer is capable of understanding and performing
                            human-like tasks based on reasoning. There is a brief historical overview of the 
                            subject and reviews the state-of-the-art and open questions in some of the major subareas 
                            of AI. There is a hands-on component that involves programming a robot (MiRo) which is
                            exciting but can become very tricky because it involves developing an appropriate algorithm 
                            or technique in order to make it perform certain tasks.
