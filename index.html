                        Hello! My name is Ana Camarasan and I am a first year Artificial Intelligence
                        and Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">The University of Sheffield</a>. I come from Romania and 
                        I chose to study in the UK because it was one of my childhood dreams. I discovered
                        my passion for computer science in highschool and I decided that I want to make a 
                        career in the field. I chose this university because of its good reviews and popularity
                        and after a semester I am happy to say that it satisfied my expectations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My other passion, my very first one is tennis. I've been practicing this amazing sport
                        since the age of 5. I played competitive tennis until the age of 12, then I kept it as 
                        a hobby and a way to relax. I have tried other sports in my childhood and teenage years,
                        but I did not feel such a connection as the one with tennis.
